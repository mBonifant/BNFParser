BNFDemoParser is a simple java program that prompts for
input files and then checks if the text in the file matches 
the specified grammer below, defined in Backus-Naur Form (hence BNF).

The definition of that grammer is reproduced here:

<sentence> => <expression>!
 
<expression> => <term> { (+|-) <term>}
 
<term> => <factor> {(*|/) <factor>}

<factor> => ( <expression> ) | identifier
 
<identifier> => [A-Za-z].




input1.txt is a sample passing string: a*b+c!
